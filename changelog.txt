Version 1.0.1
Fixes:
- Fixed Cognito Credential Provider bug that cannot refresh credential when it's expired.
- Always use UTC instead of local time, which fixes inconsistencies in the dataset metadata timestamps.
- Address issue that could clear cached Cognito identityId.
Improvements:
- Enabled CORS, so Amazon Cognito Identity and Sync can now be used inside Unity Web Player.
- Name-spaced cache to support multiple Cognito identity pools.
- Change Cognito Credential Provider Constructor. User now needs to provide only Cognito Identity Pool Id. 
- Relaxed access modifiers, allowing developers to extend some of our classes.
